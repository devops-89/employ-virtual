VR systems uses computer vision and advanced graphics to generate 3D images and video by adding depth and more sense by reconstructing the scale and distances between 2D contents. The end user will have the rights to explore and control these 3D environments using VR headsets, eye glasses and controllers which will have sensors for the users to experience the effect of VR content.",

Devices that are enabled with VR technology interprets images and videos using image location, surroundings, and appearance. So altogether there will be usage of camera with artificial intelligence, big data, and vision processing unit.",
